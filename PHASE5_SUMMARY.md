# Phase 5: Confidence-Based Matching & Production Testing

## Overview

Phase 5 focused on improving match accuracy through high-resolution perceptual hashing, confidence-based matching with temporal refinement, and addressing critical bugs discovered through production testing with real-world video content.

**Duration:** Completed October 4, 2025  
**Key Achievement:** 1024-bit hashing with confidence scoring + 3 critical production bug fixes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed and tested on Railway

---

## Phase 5A: Advanced Matching Implementation

### 1. High-Resolution Perceptual Hashing

**Upgrade:** 64-bit ‚Üí 1024-bit dHash

```typescript
// Before: 8x8 grid = 64 bits
const resized = await sharp(frameBuffer).resize(9, 8, { fit: 'fill' })

// After: 32x32 grid = 1024 bits
const resized = await sharp(frameBuffer).resize(33, 32, { fit: 'fill' })
```

**Impact:**
- **Memory:** 240KB ‚Üí 3.8MB for 31K target hashes (acceptable)
- **Detail:** 16x more information per frame
- **Accuracy:** Better handling of motion blur, similar frames, re-encoding artifacts
- **Performance:** Still fast (~2-3ms per frame vs ~1ms)

**Updated Similarity Scale (1024-bit):**
- 0-80 bits: Nearly identical (~92%+ similar)
- 81-160 bits: Very similar (~84-92%)
- 161-320 bits: Similar (~69-84%)
- 321-400 bits: Moderately similar (~61-69%)
- 401+ bits: Different (<61%)

### 2. Confidence-Based Matching System

**New Architecture:**

```typescript
interface MatchResult {
  action: 'transfer' | 'skip' | 'needs_refinement';
  targetFrame?: number;
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'none';
  reason: string;
  candidates?: Array<{ frame: number; distance: number }>;
}
```

**Three-Tier Decision System:**

1. **High Confidence** (50+ bit gap)
   - Clear winner, significant difference from 2nd place
   - Transfer immediately with ‚úì mark
   - Example: `clear_winner (0.954 sim, 73 bit gap)`

2. **Needs Refinement** (2-15 close candidates)
   - Multiple similar frames within 50 bits
   - Extract temporal neighbors for disambiguation
   - Example: `needs_refinement (5 candidates within 50 bits)`

3. **Low Confidence** (15+ similar frames)
   - Genuinely ambiguous content (static shots, repeated frames)
   - Accept best match with ? mark
   - Example: `ambiguous_23_similar_frames (0.947 sim)`

4. **Skip** (>400 bits / <61% similarity)
   - No plausible match found
   - Shot likely deleted from edit
   - Example: `no_similar_frames_found (best: 0.58)`

### 3. Temporal Neighbor Refinement

**Algorithm:**
- Extract 5-frame window: `[-5, -1, 0, +1, +5]` frames (~0.2s @ 24fps)
- Score each candidate using temporal context
- Compare total Hamming distance across all 5 frames
- Award higher confidence if winner emerges

```typescript
function refineWithNeighbors(
  sourceNeighborHashes: FrameHash[],
  candidates: Array<{ frame: number; distance: number }>,
  targetHashes: FrameHash[]
): MatchResult
```

**Refinement Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** 200+ bit improvement (40+ bits/frame average)
- **Medium:** 80+ bit improvement (16+ bits/frame average)
- **Low:** <80 bit improvement (still ambiguous)

**Performance:**
- Batch extraction: All neighbor frames in one FFmpeg call
- Parallel hashing: Process multiple frames simultaneously
- Adds 30-60s for 20-30% of comments requiring refinement

---

## Phase 5B: Production Testing & Bug Fixes

### Testing Environment
- **Video:** 21-minute master with 42 comments
- **Platform:** Railway with 32 vCPU
- **Performance:** ~5 minutes total (3.5min video processing + rate limiting)
- **Result:** Revealed 3 critical bugs affecting accuracy

---

### Bug #1: Duplicate Job Processing ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

**Symptoms:**
- Job processed twice, creating duplicate comments
- Two different job IDs in logs: `bc93168b...` and `fd63c2bc...`
- All comments transferred 2x

**Root Cause:**
Frame.io webhooks implement automatic retries:
> "Frame.io expects a response in under 5 seconds and attempts to retry up to 5 times while waiting for a response."
> ‚Äî [Adobe Developer Docs](https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/guides/Custom%20Actions/Configuring%20Actions/#interactions-retries-and-timeouts)

Our system:
1. Receives webhook
2. Returns form immediately (fast)
3. Receives form submission
4. Starts background job processing
5. **Returns success message immediately** ‚Üê Frame.io sees this as "complete"
6. **But if response slow or network glitch:** Frame.io retries
7. Each retry creates new job (no idempotency check)

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Check for existing job with same interaction_id
const existingJob = await db.query.processingJobs.findFirst({
  where: (jobs, { eq }) => eq(jobs.interactionId, payload.interaction_id!)
});

if (existingJob) {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è  Job already exists for interaction ${payload.interaction_id}`);
  return {
    title: existingJob.status === 'completed' ? "Already Processed ‚úì" : "Processing... ‚è≥",
    description: existingJob.status === 'completed' 
      ? "This request has already been completed."
      : "Your request is already being processed. Please wait."
  };
}
```

**Key Insight:**
The `interaction_id` field exists specifically for idempotency:
> "The `interaction_id` is a unique identifier to track an Action's execution as it evolves over time. The ID persists throughout any sequence of an Action, including callback forms."

---

### Bug #2: Off-by-One Frame Error ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

**Symptoms:**
- Most "‚úì" (high confidence) comments were consistently 1 frame late
- Example: Comment at frame 456 placed at frame 457

**Root Cause:**
Double frame calculation with incorrect offset:

```typescript
// Bug in comment-transfer.ts:
const targetFrameNumber = Math.round(targetTimestamp * 24) + 1;  // ‚ùå WRONG!
```

**Three Issues:**
1. **Recalculating:** Frame number already calculated correctly in matching phase
2. **Adding +1:** Incorrectly applied "Frame.io 1-indexing" offset (already handled elsewhere)
3. **Hardcoded 24fps:** Should use actual video FPS from metadata

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Use the already-calculated frame number:
const frameNumber = match.targetFrameNumber;  // ‚úÖ CORRECT!

const commentData = {
  text: commentText,
  timestamp: frameNumber,  // Direct use, no recalculation
};
```

The `targetFrameNumber` was already calculated correctly:
```typescript
// In frame-processor.ts:
const targetFrameNumber = Math.round(match.targetTimestamp * targetMetadata.fps);
```

**Key Insight:**
Trust the matching phase calculation. Don't recalculate timestamps in the transfer phase.

---

### Bug #3: Overly Conservative Confidence Thresholds ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

**Symptoms:**
- Comments marked with "?" (low confidence) had 94-97% similarity
- These "low confidence" matches were actually **bang-on accurate**
- Too many comments requiring unnecessary refinement

**Root Cause:**
Thresholds designed for 64-bit hashes didn't scale properly to 1024-bit hashes:
- Original: 80-bit gap for "high confidence"
- With 1024 bits: 80/1024 = 7.8% difference required
- Reality: Even 5% difference (50 bits) is highly significant

**Testing Insights:**
| Similarity | Old Confidence | Actual Accuracy | Should Be |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 94-97% | Low (?) | Bang-on accurate | High (‚úì) |
| 92-94% | Medium (~) | Very accurate | High/Medium |
| <92% | Needs refinement | Sometimes accurate | Medium/Low |

**Solution:**
Updated thresholds based on empirical testing:

```typescript
// Initial Matching Thresholds
const CONFIDENCE_GAP = 50;           // Was 80 (5% vs 8%)
const CLOSE_MATCH_WINDOW = 50;       // Was 80
const AMBIGUOUS_THRESHOLD = 15;      // Was 20 frames
const NO_MATCH_THRESHOLD = 400;      // Unchanged (61% similarity)

// Refinement Thresholds
const REFINEMENT_HIGH = 200;         // Was 320 bits
const REFINEMENT_MEDIUM = 80;        // Was 160 bits
```

**Impact:**
- More matches classified as high confidence
- Fewer unnecessary refinements
- Confidence indicators now match observed accuracy

## Enhanced Logging System

### Per-Match Visibility

**Before:** Generic batch summaries  
**After:** Individual match decisions with reasoning

```
üìä Phase 3a: Confidence-Based Matching

‚úì  Match "Shot 1..." ‚Üí frame 5 (95.4% sim, high)
‚úì  Match "Shot 2..." ‚Üí frame 457 (94.4% sim, high)
~  Refine "Shot 3..." - needs_refinement (5 candidates within 50 bits)
?  Match "Shot 5..." ‚Üí frame 1267 (94.7% sim, low)
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skip "Shot 13..." - no_similar_frames_found (best: 0.58)

‚úì 12 high/low-confidence matches
~ 16 need temporal refinement
‚è≠ 14 skipped (no match found)

üìä Phase 3b: Temporal Neighbor Refinement

  ‚úì Refined "Shot 2..." ‚Üí frame 457 (94.4% sim, high - refined_strong (245 bit gap))
  ~ Refined "Shot 10..." ‚Üí frame 12867 (95.2% sim, medium - refined_moderate (124 bit gap))
  ? Refined "Shot 7..." ‚Üí frame 8713 (95.3% sim, low - refined_weak (45 bit gap))

‚úÖ Refinement complete: 28 total matches

üìä Final Matching Results:
   Total matched: 28
   High confidence: 20  (71%)
   Medium confidence: 6  (21%)
   Low confidence: 2     (7%)
   Skipped: 14          (33% of original 42)
```

**Features:**
- **Emoji indicators:** ‚úì (high), ~ (medium), ? (low), ‚è≠Ô∏è (skip)
- **Similarity percentages** for each match
- **Reason codes** for debugging (e.g., `clear_winner`, `refined_strong`)
- **Per-match logging** (not per-frame during extraction)
- **Distribution summary** for quick analysis

## Performance Metrics

**Video Processing:**
- **Total time:** ~3.5 minutes for 21-minute video
- **Speed:** 6x realtime extraction and hashing
- **Target frames:** 31,195 frames @ 24fps
- **Source frames:** 42 frames (with -ss seeking)
- **Memory:** ~4MB for target hashes (1024-bit)

**Matching & Refinement:**
- **Initial matching:** ~1.5 minutes (31K comparisons √ó 42 comments)
- **Refinement:** 16 comments √ó 80 neighbor frames = ~30 seconds
- **Total matching:** ~2 minutes

**API Rate Limiting:**
- Frame.io limit: 10 calls/minute
- **Batches:** 3 batches (10 + 10 + 8 comments)
- **Wait time:** 2√ó 60s = 2 minutes between batches
- **Transfer time:** ~3 minutes total

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Idempotency Pattern
```typescript
// Pattern for all webhook-triggered operations
const existingResource = await findByTransactionId(transactionId);
if (existingResource) {
  return cachedResponse(existingResource);
}
// Create new resource...
```

### 2. Trust the Pipeline
```typescript
// Anti-pattern: Recalculating derived values
const frameNumber = Math.round(timestamp * fps) + 1;  // ‚ùå

// Better: Trust upstream calculations
const frameNumber = match.targetFrameNumber;  // ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Empirical Threshold Tuning
- Don't guess at thresholds
- Test with production data
- Adjust based on observed accuracy
- Document reasoning for future tuning

### 4. Observable Matching Decisions
- Log each match with reasoning
- Include confidence indicators
- Show similarity scores
- Track distribution for analysis

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Webhook Retry Patterns
Frame.io (and most webhook systems) implement automatic retries. Always:
- Use transaction/interaction IDs for idempotency
- Return responses quickly (<5s)
- Handle duplicate requests gracefully
- Test retry scenarios

### 2. Frame Number Indexing
Different systems use different conventions:
- **FFmpeg:** 0-indexed frames
- **Frame.io API:** Frame numbers (check docs)
- **Timestamps:** Can be converted, but use actual FPS
- **Always:** Use single source of truth for calculations

### 3. Perceptual Hash Resolution Tradeoffs
- **64-bit:** Fast, low memory, good for duplicates
- **1024-bit:** Slower (2-3x), more memory (16x), **better for similar content**
- **Choice depends on:** Video content, accuracy requirements, resources

### 4. Confidence Thresholds Are Data-Dependent
- No universal "good" threshold
- Depends on: hash resolution, video type, re-encoding quality
- **Must test with production data**
- Conservative ‚Üí more refinements ‚Üí slower but safer
- Aggressive ‚Üí fewer refinements ‚Üí faster but riskier

### 5. Testing Reveals Truth
Production testing with real content revealed:
- System was more accurate than thresholds assumed
- 94-97% similarity = reliable matches
- Ambiguity mainly in static shots (genuinely similar frames)
- "? low confidence" matches were often perfect
